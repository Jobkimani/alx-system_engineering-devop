# Web Stack Debugging #0 Overview

This marked the initiation of a series dedicated to web stack debugging projects. The objective involved addressing malfunctioning or bug-ridden web stacks within isolated containers. For each task encountered, I crafted a script designed to automate the essential commands, thereby rectifying the issues present in the web stack.

## Task Details

### Task 0: Give me a Page!
- [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): A Bash script responsible for executing Apache on a web server and ensuring its responsiveness to queries directed to the root.
